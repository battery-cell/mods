  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that function for making reverse lookup lists would be called with empty table when working on subtables of defines.riding (needed by Autodrive).
    - Removed log spam. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Pi-C_lib/discussion/6783df278f2c7896721c8b47)

  Changes:
    - Added function ascertain_rendering(id_or_object) in libs/assertions.lua.

  TODO:
    - Add more functions for dealing with prototypes in the data stage. This will happen gradually as I'm updating my other mods.

  Info:
    - I've sourced out some code I reuse in most of my mods so I can keep it up to date more easily.
    - For now, the mod contains mainly assertions (always loaded) and debugging stuff (loaded when debugging mode is active). Additional modules can be included separately.
